			<h3>Welcome to my coding camp</h3>
                <p>
                Coding is a critical skill that can accelerate a child's creative expression and logical thinking to the next level. Encouraging your child to learn coding is the one of the best paths a parent can pave for their child in their journey of learning. Congratulations on choosing this path. :)

                <h6>Software Developer turned Freelancer/ Educator/ Mother of two.</h6>
			     <p>
                      I have a MS in Computer Science. I am a software developer by profession and in the past I have worked with companies like Motorola, Nokia. Currently I am a freelancer and a part time educator and a mother of two. I have always had a passion for teaching and tech which inspried me to offer coding workshops for kids. Soon it emerged as a hobby and I am enjoying it a lot and it gives me immense satisfaction to see these little kids explore and unleash their creative expressions.
